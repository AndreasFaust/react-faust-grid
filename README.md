# React Raster ðŸ˜½

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-raster.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-raster) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

**React Raster** is an advanced grid-system based on **Styled Components**. It is highly customizable while being very easy to use. It has no further dependencies and does not force you into a Ui-Framework, you don't want to use.
React Raster uses React Hooks and Context API.

**React Raster provides:**

- Custom Breakpoints
- Custom colspan
- Free nesting of Boxes and Grids
- Custom styles for every element at every breakpoint
- Lightweight and performant architecture
- Visual control via ESC-key
- Ready for server-side-rendering

**React Raster is under development.**
**A detailed documentation with examples is about to follow.**
