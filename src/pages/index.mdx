# react-raster

An advanced grid-system based on styled-components; highly customizable while being easy to use.
Regardless, if your grid is simple or complex: react-raster simplifies layouting.

It combines features from `Flexbox` and `Grid Layout` to provide a simple yet flexible layout-interface.
On current browsers it uses the benefits of `Grid Layout`. On legacy browsers it automatically falls back to plain `Flexbox` (almost) without any changes (see Section **Flexbox**).

## Basic usage

**Scale your viewport** to see the layout changing.

Press `ESC` to see the visual control.
